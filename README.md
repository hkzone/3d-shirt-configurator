```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

1. Navigate to the **Configurator** page to start customizing your shirt.
2. Select different options for fabric, styles, and embroidery.
3. View the changes in real-time in the 3D model.

## Debugging and Configuration

To access the debug panel and fine-tune the 3D model and shaders, simply add `?debug` to the end of the URL. This will enable various parameters that allow you to adjust the scene, including:
